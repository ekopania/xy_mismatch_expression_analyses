#PURPOSE: Plot TPM by copy number for each gene family
#1) Plot TPM by copy number for same gene (ex: Does Slx copy number correlate w/ Slx expression level?)
#2) Plot TPM by copy number of other genes (ex: Does Slx copy number correlated w/ Sly, Sst1, etc expression levels?)
#3) Plot TPM by relative copy number ratios (ex: Does Slx:Sly copy number ratio correlated w/ expression levels of each gene family?)
	#NOTE: Doing correlation on a ratio might be problematic - maybe bin these and do a Wilcox test for Fisher's exact test? Should be easy to bin b/c Y-intro lines should be way off but pure strains should be the same; I guess this is kinda the same as doing a Wilcox test between the various cross types so maybe unnecessary
